[![Mortgage Solution Page](https://github.com/mackenzieweaver/MortgageCalculator/blob/main/cswloans.png)](https://csw-loan-calc.netlify.app/)

Individuals and businesses use mortgages to make large purchases without paying the entire purchase price up front. With our loan calculator app you will be able to accurately calculate what each of your payments will be for the duration of your payment term.

Here's why you should use our app
* It's free and no sign up required
* It's simple and intuitive
* It's lightning fast

### Built With

This app was built in visual studio using the .NET Framework Template but mostly leverages HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However the project also uses Bootstrap and jQuery.
